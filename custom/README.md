Folder for custom templates and static files

You can put files in the static folder and they will be accesible under `/static/<path-in-static-folder>`.

If you want to customize the templates you can put them in the templates folder in a folder named with the primary domain of your site. So if you want to have special templates for the site `example.ch` you put the templates inside `custom/templates/example.ch/`. You can copy any template and change it.
